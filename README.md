## About

Are you constantly arguing with your friends over who gets the last Snickers:tm:? Are you always pulling in opposite directions on a night out? In that case, you need the ARGULYMPICS!
Argulympics is a game built in React Native and utilising Google Firebase. Each player inputs their preferred outcome, then everyone plays a game to decide which of the players is correct. The group is then duty bound by the friendship code to carry out the winnerâ€™s will. No take backsies, no swapsies.
Also included is a single player option for if you want to practice to give yourself an unfair advantage, or simply enjoy arguing with yourself.

## Tech Used

- React Native
- JavaScript
- Firebase Realtime Database
